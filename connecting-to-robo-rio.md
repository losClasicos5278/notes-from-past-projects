Problem: Our code builds, but will not deploy. We get an error that the RoboRio is not found.
Troubleshooting:
- ping the RoboRio there a lan address and you can find the IP address if it connects via USB A in RoboRio Imaging tool
- check if the ethernet lights are blinking at all

Figured out: 
We burnt out our ethernet cable using the USB to ethernet cable. Please do NOT use these cables. Use ethernet to ethernet + ethernet to USB converter.
